        gun control has reached a fever pitch. While many Americans view guns

        The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about an unexpected correlation to the spike in

      <p class="Main-Text">
        Suicide rates in the United States have been on the rise in recent years, 
        and it is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. According to the Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide was the tenth leading cause 
        of death in the United States in 2019, with over 47,500 individuals taking 
        their own lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened concerns about the 
        mental health and well-being of individuals across the country, and suicide 
        prevention efforts are more important than ever.
      </p>
      <p class="Main-Text">
        In 2021 the American Indian / Alaskan Native population of the US was approxiamately 
        9.7 million.  This population exhibits the highest suicide rates and in 2021 the male 
        AI/AN population was estimated to be 42.6 people per 100,000 or 
        <b class="percent-highlight">0.0426%</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="Main-Text">
        Approximately <b class="percent-highlight">52.8%</b> of all suicides in the US are 
        commited via the use of a firearm.

      <p class="Main-Text">
        More than half of all firearm-related deaths (54%) are caused by suicides, and the 
        majority of all suicides (53%) involve a firearm. Despite mass shootings often receiving 
        more media attention, firearm suicides are more prevalent than homicides. The data from 
        2020 shows that 54% of all firearm-related deaths were suicides, 43% were homicides, and 
        2% were accidental discharges or undetermined causes. This marks a small decrease from 2018 
        and 2019 when firearm suicides accounted for over 60% of all firearm deaths during that 
        period. Further analysis of suicides shows that guns were involved in 53% of all suicides 
        in 2020, making them the primary method for suicide.

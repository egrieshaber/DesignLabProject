      <p class="Main-Text">
        Gun violence has become a defining feature of American society, 
        leaving a trail of death and devastation in its wake. Mass shootings 
        and school shootings have become all too common, and the debate over 
        gun control has reached a fever pitch. While many Americans view guns 
        as an essential part of their culture and identity, others see them as 
        a dangerous and deadly force that needs to be controlled. As we explore 
        the issue of gun violence in America, it is important to consider the 
        various factors that contribute to this problem and the potential solutions 
        that can help save lives.

      <p class="Section-Header">A Recent spike in violence</p>
      <p class="Main-Text">
        The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about an unexpected correlation to the spike in 
        gun incidents in the United States. With the rise of Covid-19 cases, many individuals 
        were left feeling isolated and anxious. This, coupled with political and social unrest, 
        has contributed to an increase in gun-related incidents. The statistics surrounding 
        gun violence in the United States can be alarming. 
        With each passing year, the number of incidents and deaths related to gun violence 
        continues to rise. In 2020 and 2021, these numbers reached new heights, leaving 
        many wondering what can be done to address this critical issue.
      </p>
      <p class="Main-Text">
        In 2020, there were 43,569 total incidents and 38,680 deaths related to gun 
        violence, an increase of 5% and 15% respectively from 2019. In 2021, there 
        were 61,585 total incidents and 40,028 deaths related to gun violence, an 
        increase of 41% and 4% respectively from 2020.

      <p class="Main-Text">
        While many mass shootings in the United States result in relatively low death 
        counts, there are occasional incidents that result in a disproportionately high 
        number of casualties. For example, the Uvalde shooting in Texas in November 2021 
        resulted in the deaths of 28 people, making it one of the deadliest mass shootings 
        in U.S. history. These incidents underscore the need for effective measures to 
        prevent and respond to mass shootings, as even a single such incident can have 
        devastating consequences.

        Mother Jones' data shows that from 1982 to 2023, there have been a total of 142 mass shootings 
        resulting in 1106 fatalities. A bubble map has been created to visually represent the 
        locations of these shootings, with each circle's size corresponding to the number of fatalities. 
        By hovering or touching the circles, you can access additional information about each incident. 
        The map can also be zoomed in by double clicking or scrolling to help distinguish between the 
        incidents. Additionally, there are options to filter by date range or focus solely on school 
        shootings.

      <p class="Section-Header">Suicide</p>
      
      <p class="Main-Text">
        Suicide rates in the United States have been on the rise in recent years, 
        and it is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. According to the Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide was the tenth leading cause 
        of death in the United States in 2019, with over 47,500 individuals taking 
        their own lives. The COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened concerns about the 
        mental health and well-being of individuals across the country, and suicide 
        prevention efforts are more important than ever.
      </p>
      <p class="Main-Text">
        In 2021 the American Indian / Alaskan Native population of the US was approxiamately 
        9.7 million.  This population exhibits the highest suicide rates and in 2021 the male 
        AI/AN population was estimated to be 42.6 people per 100,000 or 
        <b class="percent-highlight">0.0426%</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="Main-Text">
        Approximately <b class="percent-highlight">52.8%</b> of all suicides in the US are 
        commited via the use of a firearm.

      <p class="Main-Text">
        More than half of all firearm-related deaths (54%) are caused by suicides, and the 
        majority of all suicides (53%) involve a firearm. Despite mass shootings often receiving 
        more media attention, firearm suicides are more prevalent than homicides. The data from 
        2020 shows that 54% of all firearm-related deaths were suicides, 43% were homicides, and 
        2% were accidental discharges or undetermined causes. This marks a small decrease from 2018 
        and 2019 when firearm suicides accounted for over 60% of all firearm deaths during that 
        period. Further analysis of suicides shows that guns were involved in 53% of all suicides 
        in 2020, making them the primary method for suicide.

      <p class="Section-Header">Gun Ownership</p>
      
      <p class="Main-Text">
        "Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in gun ownership in the United 
        States, with an estimated 43% of households reporting owning at least one gun. This increase 
        has been attributed to a variety of factors, including concerns about personal safety, political 
        climate, and changes in gun laws."
      </p>

      <p class="Main-Text">
        "Data fro the Pew Research Center provides a breakdown of gun ownership in the United States by 
        demographic. It shows 
        that men are much more likely to personally own a gun compared to women, with 39% of men owning 
        a gun versus 22% of women. Additionally, gun ownership is more common among whites (36%) 
        compared to 
        the black population <b class="percent-highlight">(24%)</b>, 
        Hispanics <b class="percent-highlight">(18%)</b>, and 
        Asians <b class="percent-highlight">(10%)</b>. 
        The data also shows that gun 
        ownership increases with age, with 32-33% of those aged 30 and above owning a gun. Regionally, 
        the highest percentage of gun ownership is in the South at 35%, followed by the Midwest at 31%, 
        West at 28%, and Northeast at 20%."

        "Making sense of gun violence in the US and around the world is a challenging feat that 
        isn't particularly straightforward.  Gun memorials can play an important role in raising 
        awareness about the impact of gun violence on individuals and communities. By commemorating 
        those who have been killed or injured by firearms, gun memorials serve as a reminder of the 
        human toll of gun violence, and can help to spur conversations about the need for stronger 
        gun control measures. They can also provide a space for healing and reflection for those who 
        have been directly affected by gun violence. Additionally, gun memorials can help to counter 
        the normalization of gun violence in American culture, and can challenge the narrative that 
        guns are only used for self-defense or hunting. Overall, gun memorials can serve as a powerful 
        tool for advocacy and education around the issue of gun violence. "
      </p>
      <p class="Main-Text">
        "In 2019, the Chicago Architecture Biennial introduced the Gun Violence Memorial Project, which 
        showcases four houses made of 700 glass bricks each. The houses symbolize the average number of 
        lives lost every week in the United States due to gun violence. The exhibition also invites 
        families affected by gun violence to contribute remembrance objects at in-person collection 
        events. These objects are placed inside a glass brick, which displays the name, year of birth, 
        and year of death of the person being honored."
